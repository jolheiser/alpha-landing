  # Early Access Program

  Hi there, I'm [Paul](https://rohitpaulk.com). 
  
  [CodeCrafters](https://codecrafters.io) is currently under active development,
  but we've got the core challenge experience ready and are looking for early users
  who are brave enough to try it out.

  Here're the challenges we have lined up for testing:
    - [Build your own Redis](/challenges/redis).
    - [Build your own Docker](/challenges/docker).

  The kind of person we're looking for: 

  - Despises traditional algorithmic coding questions
  - Is an experienced programmer, familiar with either Python, Ruby or Go (or
    would like to use one of them)
  - Is interested in [Build Your Own
    X](https://github.com/danistefanovic/build-your-own-x) tutorials
  - Can spend 1-2 hours a week trying out challenges

  What you'll get:

  - Early access to challenges
  - A chance to vote on which challenges we'll work on next
  - Updates on CodeCrafters development activity
  - A variety of CodeCrafters badges, which'll be featured on your profile page
    once we launch
  - A bunch of CodeCrafters swag (T-shirts, stickers and more)


  Sounds like your cup of tea?

  Enter your email below and we'll soon send you an invite to our Discord server
  where you'll receive further instructions!

  - slug: when-will-i-receive-my-early-access-invite
    question: When will I receive my early access invite?
    content_md: |
      We're intentionally sending out invites slowly, so that we can work on
      feedback early before the next invites hit. The maximum delay we expect
      here is 1 month, not more.

      If a friend of yours received an invite earlier than you did and you want
      to take part in early access trials with them, you can [write to
      us](mailto:hello@codecrafters.io) and we'll fast-track your invite.

  - slug: what-is-an-early-access-trial
    question: What is an early access trial?
    content_md: |
      In early access trials, groups of 4-5 people attempt an upcoming challenge
      over a period of 2 weeks. We schedule these on our Discord server, which
      you'll gain access to once you get an early access invite.

      We use these trials to gain early feedback and iterate on challenges.

      When CodeCrafters launches, no participation data from these trials will
      be retained - we'll start from a clean slate.

  - slug: where-is-my-swag
    question: Where is my swag? 
    content_md: |
      If youâ€™ve participated in an early access trial and completed the
      challenge, youâ€™ll receive a message on Discord asking for your mailing
      address and T-shirt size preference. If this hasnâ€™t happened, please [let
      us know](mailto:hello@codecrafters.io).

  - slug: what-all-languages-can-i-use
    question: What all languages can I use? 
    content_md: |
      As of now:
        
      - [Redis challenge](/challenges/redis): Python, Go.

      - [Docker challenge](/challenges/docker): Go.

      We're always looking to add support for more languages. If you're part of
      [Early Access](/early-access), let us know what language you'd like added
      on our Discord server - and we'll try our best to support it in the next
      early access trial!

    title: "Stages now advance automagically"
    type: "improvement"
    description_md: |
      Earlier, users advanced from one stage to the next by manually updating the
      `current_stage` value in `codecrafters.yml` and pushing a commit.

      This is no longer required, the test runner & UI both automatically figure
      out which stage you're attempting and act accordingly.

      Thanks to [@HimaniJoshi](https://twitter.com/Himani_Joshi_) for suggesting
      this flow!

      Time to breeze through 'dem stages! ðŸ’¨ ðŸš€

    title: "Challenge #2: Build your own Docker"
    type: "announcement"
    description_md: |
      Our second challenge on offer will be [Build your own Docker](/challenges/docker).

      In this challenge, you'll build a toy Docker implementation that can pull
      an image from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) and execute commands
      in it. Along the way, you'll learn about
      [chroot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroot), [kernel
      namespaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_namespaces), the [docker
      registry API](https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/api/) and more.

      [Early access](/early-access) trials will start for this challenge will start soon. 

  - date: "14th February 2020"
    title: "Redis: Better signal handling"
    type: "improvement"
    description_md: |
      In the [Redis challenge](/challenges/redis), we weren't properly
      forwarding signals to the child process when it was being terminated. This
      resulted in multiple versions of the same program running, which caused
      failures to bind to a port for subsequent runs of the program.

      This has now been fixed. Thanks to [@Gufran](https://github.com/Gufran)
      for pointing this out!

      CodeCrafters is under heavy development, but the core course experience is
      now ready to try out. The first course on offer will be [Build Your Own
      Redis](/challenges/redis).

      Head over to [early access](/early-access) to signup! We'll invite you to
      our Discord server, where we co-ordinate early access trials.

    type: "announcement"
    description_md: |
      Announcing our first challenge: [Build Your Own Redis](/challenges/redis).

      In this challenge, youâ€™ll build an application that can speak the Redis
      protocol, and is capable of serving basic commands like `PING`, `ECHO`,
      `SET` and `GET`. Along the way, youâ€™ll learn about TCP servers, event
      loops and more.

      We'll launch an early access program soon so that you can try this out.
