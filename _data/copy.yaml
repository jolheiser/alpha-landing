  who are brave enough to try it out.

  The kind of person we're looking for:

  - Is an experienced programmer, familiar with either Python, Ruby or Go (or
    would like to use one of them)
  - Is interested in [Build Your Own
    X](https://github.com/danistefanovic/build-your-own-x) tutorials
  - Can spend 1-2 hours a week trying out challenges

  What you'll get:

  - Early access to challenges
  - A chance to vote on which challenges we'll work on next
  - Updates on CodeCrafters development activity
  - A variety of CodeCrafters badges, which'll be featured on your profile page
    once we launch

  Sounds like your cup of tea?

  Enter your email below and we'll soon send you an invite to our Discord server
