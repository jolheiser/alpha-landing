  # Early Access Program

  Hi there, I'm [Paul](https://rohitpaulk.com). 
  
  [CodeCrafters](https://codecrafters.io) is currently under active development,
  but we've got the core challenge experience ready and are looking for early users
  who are brave enough to try it out.

  Here's the first challenge that'll be released: [Build your own
  Redis](/challenges/redis).

  The kind of person we're looking for: 

  - Despises traditional algorithmic coding questions
  - Is an experienced programmer, familiar with either Python, Ruby or Go (or
    would like to use one of them)
  - Is interested in [Build Your Own
    X](https://github.com/danistefanovic/build-your-own-x) tutorials
  - Can spend 1-2 hours a week trying out challenges

  What you'll get:

  - Early access to challenges
  - A chance to vote on which challenges we'll work on next
  - Updates on CodeCrafters development activity
  - A variety of CodeCrafters badges, which'll be featured on your profile page
    once we launch
  - A bunch of CodeCrafters swag (T-shirts, stickers and more)


  Sounds like your cup of tea?

  Enter your email below and we'll soon send you an invite to our Discord server
  where you'll receive further instructions!

  This is the first CodeCrafters challenge. We're currently running [early
  access](/early-access) trials.
  
  In this challenge, you’ll build an application that can speak the Redis
  protocol, and is capable of serving basic commands like PING, ECHO, SET and
  GET. Along the way, you’ll learn about TCP servers, event loops and more.

  This challenge has **6** stages.
