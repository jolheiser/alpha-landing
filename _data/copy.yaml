  # Early Access Program

  Hi there, I'm [Paul](https://rohitpaulk.com). 
  
  [CodeCrafters](https://codecrafters.io) is currently under active development,
  but we've got the core challenge experience ready and are looking for early users
  who are brave enough to try it out.

  Here's the first challenge that'll be released: [Build your own
  Redis](/challenges/redis).

  The kind of person we're looking for: 

  - Despises traditional algorithmic coding questions
  - Is an experienced programmer, familiar with either Python, Ruby or Go (or
    would like to use one of them)
  - Is interested in [Build Your Own
    X](https://github.com/danistefanovic/build-your-own-x) tutorials
  - Can spend 1-2 hours a week trying out challenges

  What you'll get:

  - Early access to challenges
  - A chance to vote on which challenges we'll work on next
  - Updates on CodeCrafters development activity
  - A variety of CodeCrafters badges, which'll be featured on your profile page
    once we launch
  - A bunch of CodeCrafters swag (T-shirts, stickers and more)


  Sounds like your cup of tea?

  Enter your email below and we'll soon send you an invite to our Discord server
  where you'll receive further instructions!

  This is the first CodeCrafters challenge. We're currently running [early
  access](/early-access) trials.
  
  In this challenge, you’ll build an application that can speak the Redis
  protocol, and is capable of serving basic commands like PING, ECHO, SET and
  GET. Along the way, you’ll learn about TCP servers, event loops and more.

  This challenge has **6** stages.

      Our second challenge on offer will be "Build your own Docker".

      In this challenge, you'll build a toy Docker implementation that can pull
      an image from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) and execute commands
      in it. Along the way, you'll learn about
      [chroot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroot), [kernel
      namespaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_namespaces), the [docker
      registry API](https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/api/) and more.

      [Early access](/early-access) trials will start for this challenge will start soon.

    title: "Redis: Better signal handling"
    type: "improvement"
    description_md: |
      In the [Redis challenge](/challenges/redis), we weren't properly
      forwarding signals to the child process when it was being terminated. This
      resulted in multiple versions of the same program running, which caused
      failures to bind to a port for subsequent runs of the program.

      This has now been fixed. Thanks to [@Gufran](https://github.com/Gufran)
      for pointing this out!
